# LRP Visualization

You can explore the heatmaps stored in the 'Results' directory. The annotation details can be found in the 'valid.csv' file (provided in the CheXpert dataset).

If you want to reproduce the results using the trained weights then please use the weights stored inside the 'lrp-grad_cam-chexpert/Model_Weights/' directory along with the CheXpert dataset. Please put the 'lrp-grad_cam-chexpert/LRP/lrp_test_visualization.py' file inside the 'lrp-grad_cam-chexpert/Pathology_Prediction/CheXpert-Keras/' directory to generate the LRP heatmaps.
