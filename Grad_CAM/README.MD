# Grad_CAM Visualization

You can explore the heatmaps stored in the 'lrp-grad_cam-chexpert/Grad_CAM/Results/' directory. The annotation details can be found in the 'valid.csv' file (provided in the CheXpert dataset).

If you want to reproduce the results using the trained weights then please use the weights stored inside the 'lrp-grad_cam-chexpert/Model_Weights/' directory and the codes provided here along with the CheXpert dataset. You can reproduce the heatmaps combined with the input images as well.
